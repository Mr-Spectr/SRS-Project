# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Internationalization of E-Commerce Platform

## Overview

This repository contains the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the upgrade of an existing e-commerce platform to support international expansion. The objective of the project is to enhance the platform’s capabilities by adding new features and functionalities in phases, starting with basic localization and payment options, and gradually expanding to support multiple languages and currencies.

The project follows an Agile development model, specifically the **Scrum Framework**, to ensure iterative and incremental delivery.

## Laboratory Activity 04 - Task 01: SW Requirements Industry Practices

### Task Overview
- **Objective**: Review the IEEE 830 standards for writing software requirements and prepare an SRS template.
- **Action**: The SRS template includes placeholders for each section, ensuring compliance with **IEEE 830.9**. This template is intended for documenting the requirements of an e-commerce platform upgrade.

### Key Assumptions:
- The problem statement chosen for this activity is upgrading an existing e-commerce platform to support international expansion.
- The SRS template follows the format specified by IEEE 830, including sections such as Introduction, Overall Description, Specific Requirements, etc.

## Laboratory Activity 04 - Task 02: SRS Generic Template

### Task Overview
- **Objective**: Use the prepared SRS template to document the software requirements for the selected problem.
- **Action**: The SRS documents the functional and non-functional requirements of the e-commerce platform upgrade, ensuring compliance with IEEE 830.9.

### Key Considerations:
- Focus is on functional and non-functional requirements, avoiding any design details that could be translated into a design specification later.

## Laboratory Activity 04 - Task 03: Software Requirements Analysis

### Task Overview
- **Objective**: Apply requirement analysis methods such as use case modeling, stakeholder brainstorming, and requirement categorization.
- **Action**: Synthesized and structured the requirements into a well-documented formal SRS to ensure clarity and completeness. This process addresses both user and system-level requirements.

### Tools and Methods Used:
- Use case modeling
- Stakeholder brainstorming
- Categorization of requirements (functional vs. non-functional)

## Laboratory Activity 04 - Task 04: Software Requirements Verification

### Task Overview
- **Objective**: Verify the documented requirements using standard verification techniques such as peer reviews, checklists, and traceability matrices.
- **Action**: Managed version control using Git and documented any inconsistencies or missing elements through a verification report.

### Techniques Applied:
- Peer review for requirement correctness.
- Traceability matrices to ensure coverage.
- Checklists to ensure all sections of the SRS were addressed.

## Laboratory Activity 04 - Task 05: Software Requirements Validation

### Task Overview
- **Objective**: Engage stakeholders during the validation process, ensuring requirements meet end-user and stakeholder expectations.
- **Action**: Conducted validation activities such as requirement walkthroughs and stakeholder reviews. Documented any changes or refinements made during validation.

### Validation Activities:
- Stakeholder reviews and walkthroughs.
- Formal approval methods documented.
- Refinement and changes after feedback.

## Laboratory Activity 04 - Task 06: SRS Documentation and Versioning

### Task Overview
- **Objective**: Finalize and baseline the SRS document, ensuring all required sections are complete.
- **Action**: Maintained version control using Git, ensuring traceability of modifications, and submitted the final version along with change logs.

### Versioning:
- The document was version-controlled with Git to manage changes over time and maintain traceability.

## Verification and Validation

Verification techniques and validation methods have been employed to ensure the quality and correctness of the SRS document. Some of the key activities include:

- **Peer Code Review**: Ensures compliance with international coding and maintainability standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 25010).
- **Automated Unit and Integration Testing**: Verifies the accuracy of critical system components such as payment logic.
- **User Testing Across Regions**: Engages users from various regions to validate localized features.
- **Multivariate A/B Testing**: Evaluates language-specific layouts and user interactions.

## Quality Assurance

The following strategies are employed to ensure the quality of the e-commerce platform upgrade:

- **CI/CD Integration**: Use of Jenkins or GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery.
- **Load and Stress Testing**: Simulate high user loads to verify system performance under peak demand.
- **Compliance Assurance**: Ensuring that the platform meets GDPR and PCI-DSS compliance.

### Targeted Quality Goals:
- **Functional Accuracy**: ≥99.9% payment success rate.
- **User Experience**: ≥4/5 satisfaction based on usability surveys.
- **System Reliability**: ≥99.95% uptime via real-time monitoring.

## Conclusion

By adopting the **Scrum methodology** and adhering to the **IEEE 830** standards for documenting requirements, this project has successfully laid the groundwork for the internationalization of an e-commerce platform. Through detailed analysis, verification, and validation, the team ensures the platform will meet global operational demands while maintaining high-quality standards.

The iterative and incremental nature of Scrum, combined with comprehensive software requirements documentation, will provide a reliable and user-friendly solution to enable the platform's international expansion.
